## Let's Start

Finally I got time to work on this blog series.
Let us start with a review of my latest certification CRTO.
Great job rasta.


## Background
Coming to my background I did OSCP recently and have been invlolved in red teaming assignments so I thought why not give one of the most hyped red team certifications a shot.

I admit the hype is real.

## CRTO vs CRTP
I was confused b/w  CRTO and CRTP , I decided to go with CRTO as I have heard about it's exam and labs being intense , CRTP also is good and is on my future bucket list.

## Labs
So in the beginning I was kinda confused what the lab was as I thought lab isn't there , unlike PWK we keep doing courseware and keep growing and popping machines.
There is no dedicated labs you do the labs with the courseware itself this is the best thing I have seen in the implementation as you really dont't even feel the need for a lab or dedicated machines as you have 

## Timeline
So I took the course for 2 months but ended up getting done with even my exam in a month itself.
I had done a lot preparation and I recommend you have a good idea about working with C2 and getting your hands on active directory as here you will be more focused on exploitation rather working so taking notes previously is a good approach.
All modules are perfectly balanced and you learn with each and every step.You should complete all modules before jumping into the exam.

## Exam
At last the exam.
Whooosh it's really interesting 
I felt a moment where my brain got into sleep mode for hours , this was soo good.
I felt something challenging enough to freeze the brain , I was able to get 3 flags out of 4, I saw the path for 4th one but did'nt had the energy to jump in also had a tight schedule so I closed the exam in 19 hours with 3 flags.
Enumeration is the key.
I used multiple C2, payloads and what not to get this done.
At last we are done with it and let's get up and show up, we need to focus more on learning rather than passing exams and certifications.
The learning experience was very intense ,so I give a thumbs up to rasta for awesome course and recommend everyone to join.

## HIT or MISS

Definitely a HIT exam , if you want to learn red teaming I suggest to go with 2 months of lab time and keep  the things slow paced and there is too much to grasp if you are new to red teaming.

## Prerequisites

I recommend to have a sound knowledge of active directory and C2 frameworks , rest all is duly covered in the course.
